# Z80.Net.Zex
This is a command line runner of the Z80 instruction exerciser. 

It allows running the Z80 instruction exerciser on a Z80 emulator and compare the results with the expected results.
The test is implemented as a command line application since it can run for a relatively long time and it is not practical to execute them as a part of the normal unit tests run.
